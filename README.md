# Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains the source code for a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with Qt framework in C++.
The game features a graphical user interface where two players can take turns to mark Xs and Os in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
If the grid is filled up and no player has achieved this, the game is declared a tie.
